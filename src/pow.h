 * [Dpowcoin] Cached variant of CheckProofOfWork() for a full header
 * (CBlockHeader, or CBlock via inheritance). Argon2id is memory-hard and
 * expensive relative to upstream's SHA256d, and the same header's PoW is
 * legitimately re-checked at several independent points in the codebase
 * (headers-sync batch check, CheckBlockHeader() on header acceptance and
 * again on block acceptance, and disk re-reads in BlockManager::ReadBlock).
 * This lets every one of those call sites share one process-lifetime,
 * positive-only result cache instead of each re-hashing from scratch.
 *
 * Safety argument (see pow.cpp for the cache implementation):
 * - Positive-only: a failed check is never cached, so a cache hit can only
 *   ever mean "this exact header content already passed
 *   CheckProofOfWork(GetArgon2idPoWHash(), ...) at least once, at some
 *   point in this process's lifetime". A miss always falls back to a full,
 *   honest recompute -- behavior on miss is identical to having no cache,
 *   so this can only remove redundant work, never weaken validation.
 * - Keyed on header.GetHash() (cheap SHA256d), not on the Argon2id result,
 *   so even computing the cache key never requires the expensive hash.
 * - Deliberately process-global and not tied to any peer/session/sync
 *   phase -- once a header is verified once, from anywhere, every other
 *   call site benefits, including a PRESYNC that had to restart with a
 *   different peer, or a disk re-read years later.
 *
 * @param[in] header Header (or block, via CBlockHeader base) to verify;
 *                    keyed by header.GetHash().
 * @param[in] params Consensus params to check the PoW against.
 * @return true if PoW is valid (cache hit, or freshly verified and now
 *         cached); false if verification failed. A false result is never
 *         cached, so a failed check here is always a full, honest check.
